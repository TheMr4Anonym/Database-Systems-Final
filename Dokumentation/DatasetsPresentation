Introduction

-	Our Project: Energy production and consumption across borders, hast he goal of analyzing global energyefficiency, emissions, renewable energy and energytrade between countries
-	Our central datasources are:
o	World Energy Consuption
	Efficiency
	Emissions
	Trade
o	Energy Renewables
	Production/Consumption 
	Split up shares between types

Description

-	World energy consumption
o	Efficiency: Energyintensity on economic performance (kWh/USD)
o	Emissions: CO2, Methane and other enviromental hazards
o	Energy Trade: Import/Exports, dependencies between countries
-	Renewable Energy
o	Production/Consumption: TWh-Data for Biomass, Solar, Wind and Hydro Power for Trends
o	Share of renewables: differentiated by Wind, Solar and Hydro/Biomass


Connection to the Mondial-Database

-	countryCode (PK) from country connects all our datasets with the mondial database
-	Energyefficiency and emissions can be connected with economic indicators
-	Consumption can be connected to the population for consumtion per inhabitant
-	Energy trade can be compared to production to find export countries for renewables

Interesting to look at:

-	High efficiency often also high renewable share
-	CO2 intensive countries often high import/export volumes -> could be dependencies
-	Renewables often vary strongly between continents
